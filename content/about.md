## `$ whoami`    
Hi there, my friends call me Oleng, I live in Jakarta and I'm currently looking for opportunities in Data Engineering.     

I've long been interested if not mildly obsessed with workflows and metadata, their relationships, and these days, automated pipelines. 
I believe they are the core components behind modern data stacks in DataOps.     

In other words, they are the principles to automation and scheduling inside a data platform.
They serve every part of the system: ingestion, testing, cleaning, and processing.
Together with software engineering practices and tools such as Git, CI/CD, Docker/containers, Terraform, etc., it is possible to achieve repeatability, quality assurance, provenance/lineage, discoverability, and perhaps most importantly, insights to failure modes.  

I'm a self learner, even in previous part of my life. I've been a Post Production supervisor since 2009, started as data wrangler and Digital Imaging Technician (DIT). Since then as sole technical and first employee, I've designed, built, managed, and maintained 
a few SOHO sized visual post-production facilities in Jakarta, while also deeply involved in several movie projects. [Read more about it here](/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations).  

That was the beginning of what seems to me a life long experience with data, metadata, and workflows.
Data is the new oil they say, but motion picture data captured in production are _literally_ the lifeblood of every Post Production companies!
