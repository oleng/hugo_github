## `$ whoami`    
Hi there, my friends call me Oleng, I live in Jakarta and I've been a Post Production supervisor since 2009. I'm currently looking for opportunities in  Data Engineering.    

Back in 2008 I started as Digital Imaging Technician (DIT) for a production company, and became a Post-Production engineer since 2009. 
Since then I've designed, built, managed, maintained a few visual post-production facility companies in Jakarta, while also involved in most movie projects inside those companies.
[Read a brief explanation about it here](/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations).      

My current interests:       
- Open Source Softwares 
- Workflow orchestration 
- CI/CD 
- Containers
- Secrets management
- Observability
- Automated data processing, provenance/lineage, and discovery as data platform


Connect with me, I would love to chat with you:
