##### `$ whoami` 
I was a Digital Imaging Technician (DIT) for a motion picture production company, became a Post-Production engineer slash Post-Production supervisor since end of 2009.     
I've **designed**, **budgeted**, **processed purchases**, as well as **built** and **maintained** a few visual post-production facility companies in Jakarta. [Read a brief explanation about it here](/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations).      
Most of the companies I worked with were working on TV commercials on daily basis. 
I was also directly involved in several Indonesian movie titles, such as:    
- [Bebek Belur](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631681/) (2010)    
- [Garuda di Dadaku 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1987569/) (2011)    
- [Langit Ke-7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7601390/) (2012)     
- [The Raid 2: Berandal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2265171/) (2014)

Now I'm looking for work opportunities in software engineering fields, particularly in **DevOps** and **Data Engineering**.
