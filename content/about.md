## `$ whoami`    
Hi there, my friends call me Oleng, I live in Jakarta and I've been a Post Production supervisor since 2009. I'm currently looking for opportunities in Data Engineering.    

Back in 2008 I started as Digital Imaging Technician (DIT) for a production company, graduated to Post-Production Supervisor role in 2009. 
Since then as sole technical and first employee, I've designed, built, managed, and maintained a few SOHO sized visual post-production facilities in Jakarta, with deep involvements in most movie projects for those companies.
[Read a brief explanation about it here](/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations).      

My current interests:       
- Open Source Softwares 
- Workflow orchestration 
- CI/CD 
- Containers
- Secrets management
- Observability
- Automated data processing, provenance/lineage, and discovery as data platform
