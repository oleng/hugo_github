##### `$ whoami` 
I was a Digital Imaging Technician (DIT) for a motion picture production company, became a Post-Production engineer slash Post-Production supervisor since end of 2009.     
I've **designed**, **budgeted**, **processed purchases**, as well as **built** and **maintained** a few visual post-production facility companies in Jakarta. [Read a brief explanation about it here](/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations).      
I was also directly involved in several Indonesian movies, and most of the companies I worked with were working on TV commercials on daily basis. 

Now I'm looking for work opportunities in software engineering fields, particularly in **DevOps** and **Data Engineering**.
