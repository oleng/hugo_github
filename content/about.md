## `$ whoami`    
Hi there, my friends call me Oleng, I live in Jakarta and I'm currently looking for opportunities in Data Engineering.     

I've long been interested if not mildly obsessed with workflows, metadata, their relationships, and automated pipelines. 
Along with DataOps, I believe they form the core principles, components, and practices for modern data stacks to achieve near ideal data platform:
- supports reproduceability
- data quality assurance
- data provenance/lineage
- self-serve data discoverability
- perhaps most importantly, enables people to gain insights to failure modes in the system.   

At least that is what I'm aiming for currently, to be a part of the team that builds and work at such system.

I'm a self learner, even in previous part of my life. I've been a Post Production supervisor since 2009, started as data wrangler and Digital Imaging Technician (DIT). Since then as sole technical and first employee, I've designed, built, managed, and maintained 
a few SOHO sized visual post-production facilities in Jakarta, while also deeply involved in several movie projects. [Read more about it here](/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations).     
That was the beginning of what seems to me a life long experience with data, metadata, and workflows.
Data is the new oil they say, but motion picture data captured in production are _literally_ the lifeblood of every Post Production companies!
