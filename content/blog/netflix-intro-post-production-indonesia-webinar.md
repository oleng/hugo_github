I have written some notes on my experience with Netflix's webinar on introduction to Netflix's Post Production for Indonesia's audience back in August 2020, but I haven't really have a chance to properly expand and write it down as a blog entry, so this entry will be fully ready when I feel I have given it justice.

The event was titled "INDONESIA INTRO TO NETFLIX POST", and it was reported to have attendance of 300 people from various capacities in Indonesia's film industry: Visual and Audio services, Post Production supervisors, Digital Imaging Technician (DIT), cinematographers, colourists, editors, editor assistants, producers, VFX supervisors, and production school mentors.

For now, here's the [link to the slide from the event](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SSoZYnJqXoZcb5TNpHHA0HPq0KoHnvKV/view?usp=sharing).
