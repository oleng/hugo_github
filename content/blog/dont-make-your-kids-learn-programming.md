Ok, I admit that's click-baity.

What I meant is, don't push your children to learn programming for your sake, by your way. Especially if you don't know much or even anything about it.

I too don't know anything about guiding or teaching kids. But there are two suggestions that I don't think can't be wrong:

1. If you can, find out if they have interest in computer hardwares, [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is very capable & affordable. [There are](https://www.kidscodecs.com/raspberry-pi-projects/) so [many things](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-reasons-give-kids-raspberry-pi/) you can do with it, [introduce Linux](https://www.sugarlabs.org/sugar-for-raspberry-pi/), [build robots](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/build-a-robot), you'll come up with [some project ideas](https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/842-raspberry-pi-family-projects.html) in no time. Hardware is tangible & IMHO still useful to know now (even for the far future, really), there's too much abstracts in the computing world.

2. The other one is to start from [Scratch site](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/), it's a learning program for kids developed by MIT. They know a lot about computer science & teaching it. 

My opinion on young kids learning about programming is that since they have much more time to learn the fundamentals, not rushing them to produce anything & focus more on exploring by playing is going to be so much more beneficial, they'll have more natural inclination to learn by themselves & be more creative. 

A quick note on programming school for kids:

Learning with other kids in some programming school can be good, but I'm not sure if it's _that_ necessary nor _how_ good. There's always a risk (mostly hidden) element in any courses: shaping & pushing the students to be a certain type of worker instead giving the broadest & deepest foundation. So letting them explore on their own is better in my view. That's all.
