I have only come to realise this in recent years, but it has become one of the biggest enlightment of my life.


> **We  are  all  creature of story. Every single one of us is storyweaver and storyteller, we live in and for stories.**


All of us need story more than anything else, aside from physical needs like sustenance and protection from natural elements. We fight and live because we have hopes, and hopes are born from stories we tell ourselves. The opposite is true, we don't survive without hope.

Most of us just don't really grasp that because we are so wrapped up in it.

Our lives have always been shaped by stories. Politics, history, religions, future plans, our dreams. _Love_. Parents tell stories to their babies,  their hopes and dreams of their baby's future. When we no longer love it's because we don't want story from some one or some thing anymore.

_Every single one of them is story or from story, and these stories are the foundation of our reality_.

What I also came to realise is: when we don't really understand this nature of ours, we don't really understand the importance of truth in our stories, and the importance of telling the truth of our stories. That is very scary. We corrupt our reality by choosing untrue stories, and we _cannot_ escape reality.

And so, this is my revelation.
My tenet is to seek truth in stories, to keep myself true to the story I live for, and tell truth in the ones I tell.
My biggest hope is we all seek truth in our stories, that we understand it is _possible_ and our _purpose_ to do so.
