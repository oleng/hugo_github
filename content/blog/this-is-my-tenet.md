I have only come to realise this in recent years, but it has become one of the biggest enlightment of my life.

> ### We, human beings, are all creature of story.

All of us needs story more than anything else, aside from physical needs like sustenance and protection from natural elements. 

Every single one of us is a story maker and story teller, we live **in** and **for** story. Most of us just don't really grasp that because we are so wrapped up in it. 

Our lives have always been shaped by stories. Politics, history, religions, hopes, and dreams. They are all made of stories. 

_Every single one of them are stories_.

What I also came to realise is when we don't understand our nature as creature of story, we don't really understand how truthful we are to our story, and how true we are to the story we tell. That in a way is very scary. My biggest hope is we don't get lost in untrue story, and we all seek truth in our stories.

And so, this is my revelation. My tenet is to seek truth in stories, to keep myself true to the story I live for, and tell truth in the ones I tell.
