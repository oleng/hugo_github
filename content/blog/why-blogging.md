I'm blogging again. I don't think geocities still exists today, and the perception of what blogging means has changed a few times over. I'm quite certain there's little chance you'll meet someone who knows what blog stands for, or what that meant originally.

The term blog was short for [weblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-1). It's a log, on the web. Not a marketing page or online diary. Back then blogging was an exclusive domain of nerds; hackers, webmasters & sysadmins. So it used to be a list of dates, short notes & links.

But the web evolves. So now here I find myself finally writing, after reading features, picking themes, test installs, digging source codes, just the prequisites to find best (no bloat, straight forward logic) but more importantly, _least shitty_ CMS. With no disrespect to PHP programmers out there, I can't stand Wordpress & PHP CMSes in general even though my choice back then was written in Perl. Too bad I can't find a simple nice one written in Python & not Django. Since I decided to use Github for public repo, Jekyll was the obvious choice, static with markdown support is great. But it turns out to be such a pain (my tolerance level has been lowered drastically since 1999) to install for local offline dev with Docker. Hugo wins for now.

Okay, but why? Because:

- There are thoughts I need to offload, but _not_ delivered in real time, in other words they need to be evaluated more carefully.
- Most social media sucks (and not really suited) for rants or longer semi essay-ish form. And while I did write some things on those platforms, I need to remind myself that it's unfair for people following me there to have these random rambling half-pondered words shoved into their feeds.
- I found my introspection & communication skills degraded so writing exercise is needed.
- User friendly, centralized storage for my own persistent **logs** has always been a major pain point in my experience.

So anyway, here it goes.
