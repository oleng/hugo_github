      <description>I have written some notes on my experience with Netflix&amp;rsquo;s webinar on introduction to Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Post Production for Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s audience back in August 2020, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really have a chance to properly expand and write it down as a blog entry, so this entry will be fully ready when I feel I have given it justice.
The event was titled &amp;ldquo;INDONESIA INTRO TO NETFLIX POST&amp;rdquo;, and it was reported to have attendance of 300 people from various capacities in Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s film industry: Visual and Audio services, Post Production supervisors, Digital Imaging Technician (DIT), cinematographers, colourists, editors, editor assistants, producers, VFX supervisors, and production school mentors.</description>

      <title>Google&#39;s official API client libraries explained</title>

      <description>The purpose of this short explanation is an attempt for a brain dump, to maintain a central compilation of relevant links that reflects most current state of Google&amp;rsquo;s Python client libraries for their services, as they have somewhat complex to navigate sites for official libraries. Not as unusable as Microsoft or several other dinosaur companies, but enough to waste non trivial amount of time.
Figuring out their ins &amp;amp; out haven&amp;rsquo;t been fun, I found re-learning is even less fun.</description>

      <description>I have only came to realise this in recent years, but it has become one of the biggest enlightment of my life.
 We are all creatures of story. Every single one of us is storyweaver and storyteller, we live in and for stories.
 All of us need story more than anything else; aside from physical needs, like sustenance and protection from natural elements. We fight, and we live because we have hopes, and hopes are born from stories we tell ourselves.</description>

      <title>Docker tips</title>

      <description>Some useful tips for docker
  Making shortcuts for useful commands (with flags) to free up space is one time effort compared to remembering which command Docker provides. Use alias on macOS and put them in ~/.bash_profile so they&amp;rsquo;re loaded in your terminal (I use ~/.bashrc for aliases holder, which needs to be sourced unlike .bash_profile, see my .dev/dotfiles repo for more info). Alias is auto completed in bash.</description>

      <description>Disclaimers: This is not a comprehensive list. Complete security practice includes everything from user actions, hardwares, network, softwares, attack theories &amp;amp; methods, time frame period &amp;amp;etc, in other word NOT short or simple. I am not a professional security, do not trust my words or anyone easily. AFAIK as of today these are valid, re-evaluation in the future is necessary. Critiques, inputs and questions are welcome.
 TL;DR &amp;amp; take aways:  If you&amp;rsquo;re need to cover the basics, please read this compilation of basic guidelines 1 first.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t make your kids learn programming</title>

      <description>Ok, I admit that&amp;rsquo;s click-baity.
What I meant is, don&amp;rsquo;t push your children to learn programming for your sake, by your way. Especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t know much or even anything about it.
I too know nothing about guiding or teaching kids. But there are two suggestions that I don&amp;rsquo;t think can&amp;rsquo;t be wrong:
  If you can, find out if they have interest in computer hardwares, ARM based SBCs are popular, very capable, and affordable, any of these will be suited for beginner hobbyist &amp;amp; prototyping: Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Adafruit.</description>

      <description>$ whoami Hi there, my friends call me Oleng, I live in Jakarta and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Post Production supervisor since 2009. I&amp;rsquo;m currently looking for opportunities in Data Engineering.
Back in 2008 I started as Digital Imaging Technician (DIT) for a production company, and became a Post-Production engineer since 2009. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve designed, built, managed, and maintained a few visual post-production facility companies in Jakarta. Read a brief explanation about it here.</description>

      <title>Post-production facility considerations</title>
      <link>https://oleng.github.io/2019/12/26/post-production-facility-considerations/</link>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a few key points as guide to determine the technical aspects of a post-production facility based on my past experience in building a small boutique facility, but should be applicable to medium size as well. Most of the companies I worked with were working on TV commercials on daily basis, with the majority of them shot on digital cinematography cameras such as RED, ARRI Alexa, or high speed cameras like Phantom.</description>

      <title>Why blogging?</title>
      <link>https://oleng.github.io/2019/12/24/why-blogging/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m blogging again. I don&amp;rsquo;t think geocities still exists today, and the perception of what blogging means has changed a few times over. I&amp;rsquo;m quite certain there&amp;rsquo;s only maybe 1 in 200-500 chance you&amp;rsquo;ll meet someone who knows what blog stands for, or what that meant originally.
The term blog was short for weblog. It&amp;rsquo;s a log, on the web. Not a marketing page or online diary. Back then blogging was an exclusive domain of nerds; hackers, webmasters &amp;amp; sysadmins.</description>
