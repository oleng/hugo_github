      <p>I'm blogging again. I don't think geocities still exists today, and the perception of what blogging means has changed a few times over. I'm quite certain there's only maybe 1 in 200-500 chance you'll meet someone who knows what blog stands for, or what that meant originally.</p>
<p>The term blog was short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-1">weblog</a>. It's a log, on the web. Not a marketing page or online diary. Back then blogging was an exclusive domain of nerds; hackers, webmasters &amp; sysadmins. So it used to be a list of dates, short notes &amp; links.</p>
<p>But the web evolves. So now here I find myself finally writing, after reading features, picking themes, test installs, digging source codes, just the prequisites to find best (no bloat, straight forward logic) but more importantly, <em>least shitty</em> CMS. With no disrespect to PHP programmers out there, I can't stand Wordpress &amp; PHP CMSes in general even though my choice back then was written in Perl. Too bad I can't find a nice one written in Python &amp; not Django. Since I decided to use Github for public repo, Jekyll was the obvious choice, static with markdown support is great. But it turns out to be such a pain (my tolerance level has been lowered drastically since 1999) to install for local offline dev with Docker. Hugo wins for now.</p>
<p>Okay, but why? Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are thoughts I need to offload, thoughts that need to <em>not</em> be unloaded &amp; delivered in real time, in other words they need to be evaluated more carefully.</li>
<li>Most social media sucks (and not really suited) and while I did write some things, I need to remind myself that it's unfair for people following me there to have these random rambling half-pondered words shoved into their feeds.</li>
<li>I found my introspection &amp; communication skills degraded so writing exercise is needed.</li>
<li>A user friendly, centralized storage for your own always-on <strong>logs</strong> has always been a major pain point in my experience.</li>
</ul>
