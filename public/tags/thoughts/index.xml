      <description>I think I love self-learning &amp;amp; researching because I&#39;m a wanderer. I find it fun and liberating to explore a context, to jump from one thread of thought to another, tracing and pondering the connections between them. And the joy of discovering the true reasons, the map of the entire land, never gets stale. The more I do this the less interest I have in engaging with unreasonable protocols, mindless obedience and consumerism: schools of thoughts that teach &amp;ldquo;Follow us this way or you&#39;re wrong&amp;rdquo;; learning path that forsakes (even manipulates) the harder part of beginners entry just for the sake of creating artificial easy start, which in turn produces shallow graduates; Hollywood movies formulaic methods on grabbing as much attentions for commercial success regardless of anything else like emotional blackmailing, mindless &amp;ldquo;actions&amp;rdquo;, American values as heroic ideals, etc.</description>
