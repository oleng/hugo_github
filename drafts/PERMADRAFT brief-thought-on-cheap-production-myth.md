I have been trying to unload this thought for a long time, but I haven't been able to put it in the simplest & concise manner back when I was still waist deep in the industry. And so it remains in the back of my mind for almost a decade. I'm hoping writing this down here will be the end of it. 

There has been a widespread myth that a production shot with digital cameras for internet consumption equals _cheap_ production cost. That is not a big of a problem if it was taken by common people, most people  The problem is the ones who believe this were people who were supposed to be the ones who knew better.

Compared to TV (I'll make a note on movie theatre later) and older camera technologies, it is indeed **cheaper**, it takes _lower cost_ in total. **Cheap**, however I think is rarely true, and inability to make a distinction between the two is where the problem starts in real life.

Digital cameras _did_ lower the production cost compared to (celluloid) film stock or video tapes, but not _drastically low cost_ unlike the case with internet distribution. In fact for a lot of people, this assumption of "using digital cameras for production means low cost" actually _negated_ the real cost gain. 

First, the distribution cost _is_ lower when comparing common online media distribution cost to traditional media placement, but distribution is separate from production in any cases. 

Second, production cost (from pre-production, shooting, to post-production) haven't really reduced as much by digital cameras because of multi factors: 

- Technical requirements and expectations are much higher, 
- The disciplines on production stage before post-production had been in average degraded, people no longer fear to overshoot unlike in celluloid era.
- in most cases shooting also delegates the amount of work & costs of earlier production stage to post-production, in effect shifting the cost to post-production stage. massive amount of processing power & time consumed. Digital footage data compared to pre digital cameras, heavier compositing for VFX, amount of 3D scenes & 3D complexity. All these creates the illusion that todays production is much cheaper than it actually is.
